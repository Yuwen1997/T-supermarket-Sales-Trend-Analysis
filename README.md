Time series analysis of the consumer behaviours between products and promotions on the meat sold at one of the most representative supermarkets in the United Kingdom by applying Long Short-Term Memory Network
As a consequence of rising illnesses and disorders caused by poor eating habits, health awareness has recently taken a new turn. 
Many businesses have been driven out of business as a result of COVID-19. 
However, the COVID-19 crisis has caused individuals to consume more meats as a result of spending more time in the kitchen. 
Consequently, all types of red meat experienced a rise in sales volume. 
This implies that a tried-and-true sales marketing plan in place is necessary.
This research aims to examine the dynamics and market developments focusing on meat products especially beef. 
Identifying the elements that influence meat consumer behaviour in the United Kingdom is intended to help retailers understand the meat industry and, as a result, come up with strategies for choosing the appropriate sales promotion approach.
In this case study, time-series data collection meat sales were proposed by applying long short-term memory (LSTM) network which takes the historical sales data of the products as input and forecasts the demand. 
It was discovered that there is a strong link between meat intake and life phases, area, and seasons after the analysis was conducted.
Ultimately, it is interesting to learn that certain product consumption is unaffected by sales promotion efforts. 
Yet, consumer behaviour is determined by the sort of meat. Some varieties of meat are welcomed by all groups, whereas others are chosen just by others. 
Different areas favour different sorts of meat while life stages have an impact on purchasing behaviour. 
In conclusion, life stage, area, meat categories, promotion strategy, seasons, and festival culture all have a varying degree of impact on meat sales.
